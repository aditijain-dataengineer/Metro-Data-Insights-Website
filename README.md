Metro Data Insights Website

•	Leveraged real-time metro data, historical metro data, user surveys and staff interviews to gather data and performed data profiling, data modelling and pre-processing on it.

•	Engineered a data pipeline using python to join the databases, deriving important features from it to input into machine learning models, which were trained to produce predictive insights like expected crowd according to day or weather or time of day or during events.

•	Created interactive visualizations using altair to showcase these information for the Newcastle metro users.

•	Designed a website prototype using figma and tested the results with a sample demographic for user acceptance testing.



Abstract. Metro is a service which people of Newcastle use on a regular basis. Analysis done based on surveys and interviews for this project, showed that there is a lot of confusion related to metros, which can be resolved by having a dedicated metro insights website. User research informed the prototype of a new website which aims to provide information about the metro like the schedule, metro staff availability, frequency of metro, crowd etc. All these insights are generated by fetching significant features from historical metro data and training those features to become meaningful insights using machine learning. This study represents a significant step towards leveraging technology to improve public transportation services and sets a precedent for similar initiatives in other cities. A key component of this study is the focus on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). The insights are designed with user-centered principles to ensure ease of use and accessibility. Through user testing and feedback from users, the interface has been optimized to provide a seamless experience. This includes clear navigation, responsive design, and interactive features that allow users to personalize their experience.
